#On the day I was born
###The nurses all gathered 'round
And they gazed in wide wonder
At the joy they had found
The head nurse spoke up
And she said leave this one alone
She could tell right away
That I was bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
B-B-B-B-Bad 
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
Bad to the bone
